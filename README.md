# Data Journalism and D3

Analysis of the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements using information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

The current data set incldes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state, based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates. MOE stands for "margin of error."

## Description

Scatter plot between two of the data variables such as `Healthcare vs. Poverty` or `Smokers vs. Age`.

* Note: You'll need to use `python -m http.server` to run the visualization. This will host the page at `localhost:8000` in your web browser.

### Level 2: Impress the Boss (Optional Challenge Assignment)

Why make a static graphic when D3 lets you interact with your data?

#### 1. More Data, More Dynamics

You're going to include more demographics and more risk factors. Place additional labels in your scatter plot and give them click events so that your users can decide which data to display. Animate the transitions for your circles' locations as well as the range of your axes. Do this for two risk factors for each axis. Or, for an extreme challenge, create three for each axis.

* Hint: Try binding all of the CSV data to your circles. This will let you easily determine their x or y values when you click the labels.

#### 2. Incorporate d3-tip

While the ticks on the axes allow us to infer approximate values for each circle, it's impossible to determine the true value without adding another layer of data. Enter tooltips: developers can implement these in their D3 graphics to reveal a specific element's data when the user hovers their cursor over the element. Add tooltips to your circles and display each tooltip with the data that the user has selected. Use the `d3-tip.js` plugin developed by [Justin Palmer](https://github.com/Caged)â€”we've already included this plugin in your assignment directory.
